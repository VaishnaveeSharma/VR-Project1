# 4331 Virtual Reality Project 1 in A-Frame

This project mainly focuses on the human experience from 'inside out' vr. My project has many 3D gltf models (downloaded from othersites), some 3D models (created by me), dynamic objects to interact with, some objects having animation, controlled lighting for day/night simulation, audio sounds which give the feel of being present in the environment. The loading time of the project webpage is 4.98 seconds.

# Motivation/ Idea

Covid-19 has affected all of us in some way or the other. Many of us bored of sitting at home we miss going out. Also when we go out for urgent work we have to carry mask and sanitizer with us for safety purposes. Despite causing a lot of troubles for humans Covid-19 proved to be good for the 'nature'. The air pollution, water polltion has reduced considerably, birds and animals are becoming more flourished even in the cities. 
So my idea was to highlight the good effects of corona virus in my project like the ones I have mentioned above. To make the difference visible easily i hav ecreated two environments which shows the before and after covid-19 simulation of a city.

# Issues

Honeslty, it was a challenging to project. But at the same time it was fun and learning to work on it. While working on the project there were many issues which i have faced. Some of them are:-

## Smooth cursor movement

Nausea is a very common feeling while experiencing VR. It took me a lot of research to make the cursor movement as smooth as possible for the user so that the problem of nausea is minimised. For this i first used teleporting but the results with teleporting were not appreciable. so then i looked for other ways and finaly found 'movement-controls' which gave me good results.

## Creating 3D models in Blender

I just loved craeting the model in blender now. But initially it took me a very long time to get my hands work on blender. I have watched a number a videos for that on youtube some of them are:-
